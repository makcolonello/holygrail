Module 25 Full-Stack Holy Grail Application

Created a Redis container on Docker locally. Using this container on port:8001. 
I had to downgrade Redis to version 3.0.2 to be able to have the code work and run the application on localhost:3000. 

Here are some screenshots showing my docker container and the localhost:3000 running as well as it updating locally on my terminal.
